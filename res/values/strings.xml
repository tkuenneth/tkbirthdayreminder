<b>TKBirthdayReminder</b> organizes birthdays. It adds them to your regular contacts databse. 
Consequently, to rename, add or delete an entry, switch to <i>Contacts</i>.
Birthday dates, of course, are set or changed using <b>TKBirthdayReminder</b>.
\nAn easy to handle list shows the next birthdays and how old the persons become.
Additionally, once a day the program reminds you if one or more of your contacts have birthday.
To change the notification time, press the Menu button.

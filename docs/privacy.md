This privacy policy contains information about how TKBirthdayReminder handles your data. It was last updated 2025/04/24.

We respect your privacy.

- We do not process your data.
- We do not collect your data.
- We do not track you.
- We do not sell or let any other third parties use your data.
- The app contains no advertisements.

When you send an email to the TKBirthdayReminder support team, we keep a record of our communication until the support case is closed. This includes:

- your email
- your name
- the conversation history

This is the only personal information we temporarily store. As soon as the support case is closed, the records are deleted.

### Important

To fulfill its purpose, the app must access user account data and the
contacts database. Besides editing, grouping and displaying birthday-related information TKBirthdayReminder does not process the data any further. Specifically it does not send the data to third party servers.

Please be aware that TKBirthdayReminder relies on other services, specifically core Google Android Platform services, the Google Contacts API, Google Calendar API and Google Tasks API. How and what data these services process may not be controllable by TKBirthdayReminder.
